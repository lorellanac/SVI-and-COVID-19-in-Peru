# SVI-and-COVID-19-in-Peru
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems and has highlighted the inequities that affect communities. Peru has been one of the most affected countries in the world. COVID 19 constitutes a stress factor for the communities in the different geographical areas of the country. Adapting and applying measurements like the social vulnerability index (SVI), can help to determine how resilient a community is when faced with multiple stressors that can affect its health, including the pandemic. 

Objective
To evaluate and determine the social vulnerability in different provinces and districts of Peru in the context of the COVID19 pandemic.

Methods
Ecological, observational, and cross-sectional study. We adapted the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and collected indicators related to COVID-19. We then organized and analyzed the population data of the 196 provinces of Peru, using data from the Ministry of Health (MINSA), the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), and the 2017 National Census. 

Results
We found a distribution of high and very high SVI  in the mountainous areas of Peru. High and very high social vulnerability indexes, due to the presence of some or all of the variables (socioeconomic status, household composition, race, ethnicity, belonging to a minority group, language, housing, and transportation), were predominantly distributed in the provinces located in the southern and highlands of the country. 
The highest COVID-19 mortality rate average was 421 per 100,000 inhabitants and was found in areas with moderate SVI-COVID19. The association between the mortality rate and social SVI-COVID19 was inverse, the higher the vulnerability, the lower the mortality.

Conclusions
Our results identify that the provinces with high and very high vulnerability indexes are mostly located in rural areas nearby the Andes Mountains, not having a direct correlation with COVID mortality.
